**Utility Cam - Smart Temporary Photo Storage**

Take temporary photos that automatically delete themselves after a set time. Perfect for parking spots, shopping lists, temporary receipts, event info, or anything you need to remember briefly but don't want cluttering your main gallery forever.

**WHY UTILITY CAM?**

Your gallery is full of photos you only needed temporarily - parking lot locations, store hours, product labels, reminder notes, or quick reference shots. Utility Cam solves this by automatically deleting these utility photos after you're done with them, keeping your main gallery clean and organized.
